Nosh Notes is a restaurant bookmarking and tagging app.

The Android client is written by @sienatime and the iOS client is written by @jqsilver.

Users can search for places using the Google Maps Places API and save them for later, adding personal notes and tags. Users can then see a list of their saved places, or view them on a map.

Android architecture:
- MVVM
- Jetpack Compose
- Repository/data source pattern
- coroutines
- Flows
- Ktor and KotlinX serialization
- Dagger
