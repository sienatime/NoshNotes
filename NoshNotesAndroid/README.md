## Local Development

- Provide a valid `app/google-services.json`
- Save a Google Maps API key in `local.properties`
```
MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
- If you haven't added the debug keystore to the repo, you need to add it to the Google Cloud project. 
Edit the Maps API key with the package name and the SHA it tells you. It may take a while to take effect.
